**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room client, Draw it or Lose it, wanted to develop a cross-platform software game that is based on a gameshow from the distant past. This game enables individuals to guess the puzzle based on clues from rendered images.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I think I did the design constraints well, doing this set the tone for the design document because it enables me to provide clear guidelines and limitations that assist in the focus of the design process.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
I find the evaluation process helpful in giving me a quick summary on the different operating systems, the different development tools, and client-side requirements.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
If I had to choose a part of my document to revise, I would revise my recommendations. I would do this by adding additional information on concepts that might seem confusing or make it easier to understand.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I interpret user needs by translating them into a goal they wish to accomplish for their application. Doing this transforms their needs into solution specific goals that is required to meet their end goal. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I approach designing a software by closely following the client’s request. I also try to understand the problem the client is trying to solve and seek clarifications whenever possible. In addition, my approach on software designing involves making use of helpful tools and frameworks, architectural principles, and patterns.
